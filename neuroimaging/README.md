# Neuroimaging Tutorials

- [fMRI Preprocessing at UMD](https://github.com/hspopal/tutorials/tree/main/neuroimaging/umd_preprocessing)
- [Univariate neuroimaging analyses with nilearn](https://github.com/hspopal/tutorials/tree/main/neuroimaging/univariate_analyses)


## Helpful Resources
- [Nilearn First Level Modeling](https://nilearn.github.io/stable/auto_examples/04_glm_first_level/index.html)
  - Includes a series of tutorials on various aspects of first level modeling such as doing a basic first level analysis, an FIR analysis, creating your design matrix, and more
- [Example of First Level Modeling](https://nilearn.github.io/stable/auto_examples/04_glm_first_level/plot_bids_features.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-04-glm-first-level-plot-bids-features-py)
  - My favorite method to do first level modeling with Nilearn
  - This relies on creating first level model objects, similar to how scikit-learn makes model objects for machine learning analyses

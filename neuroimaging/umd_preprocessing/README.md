## Background Information
These series of scripts were written to get a new MRI project started, download data, and preprocessing it using fmriprep. These steps are done on a lab server, such as neuron in the DSCN lab. The fmriprep preprocessing takes place on the BSWIFT2 high performance cluster (HPC). The scripts can be modified for your needs, for different datasets and servers. All of the scripts references in this documentation are available in the `code` directory. These scripts will have to be placed in specific locations for them to work together. All of those details are noted below.
